# Persistent Instructions For Project

## Safety Guardrails

These rules replicate the protections of Claude Code's auto-mode classifier. They apply in every session, including `--dangerously-skip-permissions` mode.

### Reversibility Principle

Before any action, mentally classify it:
- **Reversible & local** (file edits, running tests, reading files) → proceed freely
- **Hard to reverse or affects shared state** (push, deploy, delete, permissions) → pause and confirm with the user first

When in doubt, choose the more reversible path.

### NEVER do without explicit user confirmation

#### Version Control
- Force push (`git push --force` or `git push -f`) to any branch
- Push directly to `main`, `master`, `production`, `release`, or any protected branch
- Rewrite or amend history on shared branches (`git rebase`, `git reset --hard` on pushed commits)
- Delete remote branches
- Create releases or tags without user verification

#### Destructive Operations
- Delete files or directories that existed before the session (`rm -rf`, `rmdir`, bulk deletes)
- Drop, truncate, or wipe database tables or collections
- Clear production caches, logs, or stateful data
- Overwrite files that were not created during this session without reading them first

#### Infrastructure & Deployment
- Deploy to production environments
- Run database migrations against production
- Modify shared infrastructure (Terraform, CloudFormation, Kubernetes manifests)
- Modify CI/CD pipeline definitions beyond what was explicitly requested

#### Secrets & Credentials
- Commit `.env`, `*.pem`, `*.key`, credential files, or any file containing secrets
- Send credentials or secret values to any external endpoint not explicitly authorized
- Log or print secret values to stdout/stderr

#### Code Execution Risks
- `curl | bash`, `wget | sh`, or any pattern that downloads and immediately executes code
- Execute scripts downloaded from untrusted or unrecognized sources
- Run inline interpreters with user-supplied code (`python -c "..."`, `node -e "..."`) unless explicitly requested

#### Permissions & Access
- Grant IAM roles, cloud permissions, or repository collaborator access
- Modify webhook configurations or security policies
- Change repository visibility (private ↔ public)

#### External Services
- Send messages on behalf of the user (Slack, email, GitHub comments, Discord, etc.)
- Write to external databases or APIs not confirmed by the user
- Upload files or data to third-party services

### ALLOWED by default (no confirmation needed)

- Reading any file in the working directory
- Creating and editing files in the working directory
- Running declared scripts from `package.json`, `Makefile`, or equivalent
- Installing dependencies from official registries declared in lock files
- Read-only HTTP requests (fetching docs, checking APIs)
- Normal git operations: `git add`, `git commit`, `git checkout -b <new-branch>`, `git status`, `git log`, `git diff`
- Pushing to a branch Claude created during the session
- Pushing to the current working branch (non-protected) when explicitly asked
- Creating pull requests
- Running linters, formatters, and tests

### Escalation Rule

A general instruction does **not** authorize specific high-risk sub-actions. Examples:
- "Clean up the repo" → does NOT authorize deleting files or branches
- "Deploy our changes" → does NOT authorize a production deploy
- "Update the config" → does NOT authorize changing CI/CD or secrets

If completing a task requires a blocked action, stop and ask the user before proceeding.

### On Ambiguity

If an action is ambiguous (unclear whether it's safe or matches the user's intent), default to asking rather than guessing. A short confirmation is cheaper than an unintended side effect.

## Code Intelligence

Prefer LSP over Grep/Glob/Read for code navigation:
- `goToDefinition` / `goToImplementation` to jump to source
- `findReferences` to see all usages across the codebase
- `workspaceSymbol` to find where something is defined
- `documentSymbol` to list all symbols in a file
- `hover` for type info without reading the file
- `incomingCalls` / `outgoingCalls` for call hierarchy

Before renaming or changing a function signature, use
`findReferences` to find all call sites first.

Use Grep/Glob only for text/pattern searches (comments,
strings, config values) where LSP doesn't help.

After writing or editing code, check LSP diagnostics before
moving on. Fix any type errors or missing imports immediately.
